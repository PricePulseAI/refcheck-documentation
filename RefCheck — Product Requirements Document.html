          <h3>Components</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Application (UI):</strong> Built in Bubble (no-code) or React front-end for recruiters to initiate checks, monitor progress, and view reports. Also hosts the reference input form (mobile-friendly, accessible via secure link).</li>
            <li><strong>Communication Layer:</strong> Email (and SMS) sender service to dispatch reference invitations and reminders, with proper domain authentication (SPF/DKIM) to maximize deliverability. Uses external providers (e.g., SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS) for reliability and tracking deliveries/opens.</li>
            <li><strong>Database &amp; API Backend:</strong> Stores users, candidates, reference contact info, question templates, and responses. All sensitive data (reference answers, contact details) encrypted at rest. Exposes secure API endpoints (e.g., for ATS integration or retrieving reports).</li>
            <li><strong>AI Engine Integration:</strong> Connects to NLP services (like OpenAI or Google NLP) via a modular service layer for sentiment analysis and summary generation. This abstraction allows easy switching of providers or models. It runs via serverless functions that send reference responses to the AI API and returns structured insights, with safeguards (token limits, caching of common analyses) to control cost and ensure responsiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>Workflow Scheduler:</strong> Handles background jobs – sending follow-up reminders, scheduling daily summary emails, and triggering analysis once all responses are in. Ensures these run reliably (e.g., using Bubble’s backend workflows or a Node/cron service).</li>
            <li><strong>Integration Hooks:</strong> Webhook endpoints to receive triggers from ATS (for automated reference check start when a candidate hits that stage) and to send back completion events or data to external systems as needed.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="code-head"><span>Service Map</span><span class="code-lang">TypeScript</span></div>
          <pre><code>const services = {

  backend:  ['authService','dataStore','scheduler'],
  integrations: ['emailAPI','smsAPI','ATSwebhook','AIanalysisAPI'],
  aiEngine: ['sentimentAnalyzer','summarizer','redFlagDetector']
};</code></pre>
          <h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Least privilege:</strong> If connected to ATS or HR systems, only minimal data (candidate name, role) is taken in; reference invitations require only name and email. No unnecessary personal data collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All stored reference feedback and personal info are encrypted in the database. In transit, all links and forms are served over HTTPS. Each reference’s form link contains a secure token so that only they (with the email link) can access it.</li>
            <li><strong>Data isolation:</strong> Each company’s data is siloed; no cross-company access. Role-based access ensures even within a company, only authorized users can view certain information (e.g., only recruiters see candidate reference details).</li>
            <li><strong>Consent &amp; compliance:</strong> Candidates are typically asked for permission to contact references outside the app. References are informed that their feedback will be kept confidential and used solely for hiring. We log consent where required and comply with GDPR/CCPA for data removal requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Audit logging:</strong> Key events (like who sent a reference request, when a reference responded, when a report was viewed) are logged to an audit trail for security reviews and to diagnose any issues.</li>

They can type or use voice-to-text; the AI assistant prompts them for clarity and examples, making the process feel like a quick conversation rather than a tedious form.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Feedback Analysis (P0):</strong> Real-time natural language processing on incoming reference answers to evaluate sentiment, detect red flags (like hesitation or negative indicators), and score the tone of each response. Ensures no subtle warning goes unnoticed.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Summary Report (P0):</strong> Once all references respond, generate an easy-to-read report: an AI-written summary of the candidate’s references, a list of all responses (organized by question), and any flagged concerns highlighted for review.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Questions &amp; Templates (P0):</strong> Ability to import or create reference questionnaires. Users can use a default template or tailor questions to the role, with an AI assistant suggesting improvements or additional questions. Save templates for reuse across jobs.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduling &amp; Notifications (P0):</strong> Option to schedule reference checks (e.g., send requests at a specific time) and receive notifications when references are completed or if deadlines pass. Daily email digests can inform a user of any pending or completed reference checks.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Dashboard &amp; History (P1):</strong> In-app dashboard to track all ongoing and completed reference checks, their status (e.g., 2/3 references done), and quick stats (average reference rating, flags). Allows users to quickly see where attention is needed. Also supports exporting or printing reports.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Collaboration (P1):</strong> Invite one additional user (e.g., a hiring manager or HR colleague) with viewer access to view reports. Supports basic role-based access so only certain people can initiate or view reference checks.</li>
            <li><strong>ATS Integration (P1):</strong> Connect with popular Applicant Tracking Systems via Zapier or native integration. For example, automatically trigger RefCheck when a candidate moves to “Reference Check” stage, and push the summary back to the ATS notes when complete.</li>

          <h2>1) Setup &amp; Customization <span class="priority p0">P0</span></h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Initiating a Check:</strong> The recruiter creates a new “Reference Check” entry by inputting the candidate’s name, job role, and email (for context) and listing their references’ names, relationship, and contact emails. The UI supports collecting 2–4 references by default (with option to add more).</li>
            <li><strong>Template Selection:</strong> The user chooses a questionnaire template for that role. Default templates (e.g., “Standard Professional Reference”) are provided. If a custom template is needed, they can create one on the fly by adding/editing questions in a simple form. (Question types include Likert-scale ratings, Yes/No, and open-ended text.)</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Assisted Template Builder:</strong> An optional AI helper chat can guide template creation. For example, the user can type, “I want to ask about teamwork and reliability,” and the AI suggests a well-phrased question for each. It can also analyze an imported list of questions (from a CSV or pasted text) and auto-format them into the system, flagging any confusing wording.</li>
            <li><strong>Import Existing Form:</strong> If the company already has a reference questionnaire (e.g., a Word document or Google Form), they can import it. The system will map it into our format (with AI help resolving any mismatched fields). This lowers adoption barriers by not forcing a switch away from familiar questions.</li>
            <li><strong>Configuration Options:</strong> The setup allows toggling certain settings per check: e.g., whether the candidate can be automatically notified when references are complete (usually off, to keep it internal), the deadline for references to respond (after which recruiter is alerted), and the schedule for reminders (defaults: 2-day and 5-day reminder emails if no response).</li>
            <li><strong>Launch &amp; Tracking:</strong> Once configured, the recruiter hits “Send Requests.” The app immediately emails each reference a personalized invitation containing a secure link. The recruiter is taken to a tracking view (status page) for that reference check, which updates in real-time as references respond.</li>
            <li><strong>Demo Mode:</strong> New users can launch a sandbox reference check (with a fictitious candidate and AI-generated reference responses) to instantly see a sample final report. This one-click demo helps build confidence and understanding of RefCheck’s output during onboarding.</li>

        <!-- Feature: Reference Collection UX -->
        <section id="feature-collection" class="section">
          <h2>2) Reference Collection UX <span class="priority p0">P0</span></h2>
          <h3>Process &amp; Experience</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Invitation Email:</strong> Each reference receives a branded email from the recruiter’s company (via RefCheck) explaining that they’re invited to provide a reference for [Candidate Name] applying for [Job Role] at [Company]. The email emphasizes the quick, user-friendly process and confidentiality of their input to encourage prompt participation.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Access:</strong> The email link takes the reference to a secure web page (unique token in URL, no login needed). The page greets them by name, reiterates the purpose (reference for [Candidate]) and approximate time required (e.g., “about 5 minutes”). References on mobile devices see a mobile-optimized view.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversational Q&amp;A:</strong> Instead of a static form, an on-page AI assistant (text chatbot interface) guides the reference through the questions one by one:
              <ul>
                <li>It might start: “Hi [Reference Name], I’m assisting [Company] with collecting a reference for [Candidate]. Let’s begin with an easy one: How would you describe [Candidate]’s overall performance at [Company]?”</li>
                <li>The reference types their answer into a chat bubble (or uses the microphone icon to speak it, leveraging browser speech-to-text if available).</li>
                <li>The assistant then posts the next question, possibly adjusting phrasing dynamically. For instance, if the reference mentions something significant, the AI could follow up: “You mentioned leadership skills. Can you give an example of [Candidate] demonstrating leadership?”</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Guidance &amp; Encouragement:</strong> The AI assistant uses prepared question templates combined with NLP to prompt for clarity or depth when needed. If a reference gives a very brief answer, it might gently ask, “Could you elaborate a bit, maybe an example?” This helps gather useful data without the reference needing to think about format. The tone remains polite and appreciative throughout.</li>
            <li><strong>Progress Indicator:</strong> A simple indicator (e.g., “Question 3 of 5”) or a progress bar is shown so the reference knows how many questions remain. This transparency helps them commit to finishing the form.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> The interface reassures references that their responses are confidential and shared only with the hiring team (not the candidate). We also remind them the process is quick (“about 5 minutes”) to encourage prompt, honest participation.</li>
            <li><strong>Skip or Save Options:</strong> If a reference truly can’t answer a question (e.g., “I didn’t observe them in that area”), they can skip. The assistant will record a placeholder like “Not observed by reference.” They can also save progress and resume later via the same link, though the process is short enough that drop-offs should be minimal.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Review &amp; Submit:</strong> After the last question, the assistant summarizes the reference’s input: “Here’s a summary of your feedback. Please review and click Submit if it looks accurate.” The reference can scroll through all their answers (the assistant may have lightly cleaned up obvious typos in real-time), make any edits, and then submit officially. Upon submission, they see a thank-you message. We optionally offer a chance to provide meta-feedback (“How was this experience?” 1-5 stars) to continually improve the UX.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted"><strong>Note:</strong> This conversational approach is designed to make the task feel like answering a colleague on chat, rather than filling a formal survey. Early research indicates this can significantly improve both the quality of responses and the likelihood of completion.</p>

        <!-- Feature: AI Analysis & Reporting -->
        <section id="feature-analysis" class="section">
          <h2>3) AI Analysis &amp; Reporting <span class="priority p0">P0</span></h2>
          <h3>Automated Analysis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-time sentiment analysis:</strong> As each reference submits their answers, the system runs an NLP sentiment analysis on the text. It scores responses (e.g., on a scale or just positive/neutral/negative) and tags any particularly strong positive language (“outstanding, always exceeded expectations”) or negative phrases (“consistently late, wouldn’t rehire”) for review. This happens behind the scenes, so by the time all responses are in, we have a sentiment profile ready. It errs on the side of caution – by default only flagging clear negative signals to avoid false alarms.</li>
            <li><strong>Red flag detection:</strong> The AI is tuned to pick up subtle warning signals. For instance, if a reference answer contains diplomatic phrasing that might mask a concern (e.g., “He eventually got the job done, but required more guidance than most.”), the system flags that sentence. It also notes if any reference gave a notably weaker endorsement compared to others (e.g., two references are glowing, one is lukewarm).</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency &amp; fraud checks:</strong> The system cross-checks key facts (like employment dates or titles if mentioned) against the candidate’s info for consistency. It also analyzes linguistic patterns; if two different references typed extremely similar answers, it might flag possible collusion or candidate-written answers. While we can’t fully verify authenticity, these AI-driven checks provide leads for recruiters to follow up on if something seems off.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Reporting</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Compilation of answers:</strong> Once all references have responded or the deadline passes, RefCheck compiles a report. Every question is listed with each reference’s answer beneath it (labeled by reference name or “Reference 1/2” anonymized if needed). This structured view ensures the recruiter can compare responses across references question by question.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-generated summary:</strong> At the top of the report, a summary paragraph (or a few bullet points) highlights the main takeaways. For example: “Jane’s references consistently praised her reliability and customer service skills. One noted she could improve technical knowledge, but all said they would gladly work with her again.” This summary is generated by the AI after analyzing all answers together. It is written in a professional, neutral tone, and gives an at-a-glance narrative of the candidate’s reputation.</li>
            <li><strong>Scoring &amp; indicators:</strong> The report might include a simple visual indicator for each reference’s overall sentiment (happy face for positive, neutral face for neutral, sad face for negative, or a numerical score out of 10). Flagged content is highlighted (e.g., yellow for mild concern, red for serious) to draw attention. If multiple references raise the same issue, the system elevates its importance in the summary.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow-up suggestions:</strong> For significant concerns identified, the report can list suggested follow-up questions for the candidate. For example, if punctuality issues are flagged, the report might recommend asking the candidate about time management in their next interview. This turns reference insights into actionable guidance for recruiters.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive exploration (web report):</strong> Within the app, the recruiter can click on a flagged phrase to see context, or hover on a sentiment score to see an explanation (e.g., “Reference’s tone was mostly positive, with minor reservations about punctuality”). This helps the recruiter quickly zero in on areas to discuss further with the candidate or to double-check details.</li>
            <li><strong>Downloadable output:</strong> The entire report can be exported as a PDF or printed directly, formatted with company branding if desired. This is useful for attaching to candidate files or sharing with decision-makers who prefer offline review.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>AI Tuning &amp; User Feedback</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Recruiter’s AI assistant:</strong> On the recruiter side, an AI chat assistant is available to answer questions about the report or refine it. A recruiter might ask, “Did any references imply hesitancy?” and the assistant can point out, “Reference 2 hesitated on the rehire question, saying ‘probably, yes’ – flagged as mild concern.” The recruiter can also instruct, “Treat ‘requires guidance’ comments as a significant flag for our company,” and the system will adjust its flagging sensitivity for future reports (and even retroactively highlight those phrases in current reports).</li>
            <li><strong>Calibration mode:</strong> Recruiters can run a test reference check on themselves (or a fictional candidate) to see how the system works. The AI can generate sample reference answers (or the user can fill it in), and then show the resulting analysis. This sandbox helps build trust in the AI and allows the user to fine-tune thresholds (for example, deciding what sentiment score counts as “negative”). Calibration mode is also useful during initial setup or trial to demonstrate the value quickly, even before a real candidate’s references come in.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback loop:</strong> After viewing a report, the recruiter can rate the AI-generated summary’s accuracy (e.g., thumbs-up or thumbs-down). This feedback is logged and helps refine our models. It also gives the user a sense of control — if they mark a summary as inaccurate, the system notes it and can adjust its analysis settings over time for that organization.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <!-- Feature: Integration & Automation -->
        <section id="feature-integration" class="section">
          <h2>4) Integration &amp; Automation <span class="priority p1">P1</span></h2>
          <h3>Workflow Automation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Auto email reports:</strong> Users can schedule an automatic email of the updated report (e.g., every day at 8am, or every Monday). The system will fetch new responses and send the compiled PDF or link on schedule. All emails are sent from a verified domain to ensure they arrive in inboxes (no-noreply addresses, proper SPF/DKIM set up).</li>
            <li><strong>On-demand refresh:</strong> A “Refresh Now” button triggers an immediate data pull and regenerates the report on command, for up-to-the-minute referencing.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Sheets sync (future):</strong> Planned ability to link a Google Sheet for live updates (v1 may allow manual export to Sheets instead of file download).</li>
            <li><strong>Failure alerts:</strong> If a scheduled refresh fails (e.g., an API is down or token expired), the system will automatically retry once after a short delay. If it still fails, the user is then notified via email (and/or in-app) with error details and guidance (e.g., reconnecting the integration).</li>
            <li><strong>SMS invites (future):</strong> While not in the initial MVP, we plan to offer the ability to send reference requests and reminders via SMS or messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp) in a post-v1 update. This can boost engagement for references who are more responsive to texts than email.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>External Integrations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ATS trigger integration:</strong> Via Zapier or a direct webhook API, RefCheck can listen for events (e.g., “Candidate moved to Reference Check stage” in Greenhouse/Lever) to auto-create a reference check draft with the candidate’s info. The recruiter would then just confirm references and send, saving time and ensuring no candidate is missed.</li>
            <li><strong>ATS data write-back:</strong> After a reference check completes, RefCheck can send a summary note or attach the PDF report to the candidate’s profile in the ATS through an API or Zap. This keeps everything in one place for record-keeping and for hiring managers who might not log into RefCheck directly.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar integration:</strong> (Post-MVP) If a reference prefers a live call, the recruiter can mark that and the system could schedule a calendar event for a call, providing a one-click dial and a list of questions as an agenda (bridging traditional calls into our workflow).</li>
            <li><strong>Public API &amp; webhooks:</strong> For enterprise or tech-savvy clients, a public API will allow programmatic initiation of reference checks and webhooks will provide real-time push of results. This means companies can integrate RefCheck into custom workflows or HR chatbots beyond standard ATS systems.</li>

          </div>
          <h3>Roles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Owner/Admin:</strong> Full access – can connect/disconnect integrations, send reference requests, view all data, and manage subscription.</li>
            <li><strong>Recruiter/Contributor:</strong> Can initiate reference checks and view results for their candidates. (In MVP, this is effectively the same as Owner if only one user, but we plan to support multiple recruiters each limited to their own jobs in future versions.)</li>
            <li><strong>Viewer:</strong> Read-only access – can view and download reports, but cannot send requests or modify settings. Ideal for a hiring manager or external HR advisor who needs to review reference results without editing capabilities.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Collaboration Usage</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>**Shared dashboard:** Within a company account, authorized users can see a list of reference checks (optionally filtered by who created them or by department). This prevents duplicate efforts (e.g., two recruiters accidentally checking references for the same candidate) and allows easy hand-off if someone is out of office.</li>
            <li>**Invite a hiring manager:** A recruiter can share a specific reference report with a non-RefCheck user via a secure one-time link or by adding them as a Viewer user. This ensures hiring managers see the feedback directly. The secure link expires for safety, while a Viewer user login persists for ongoing needs.</li>
            <li>**Activity logging:** In multi-user scenarios, actions are tagged with the user’s name (e.g., “Jane (Recruiter) sent 3 reference requests on Aug 5”). This is displayed in the check’s activity feed. If an admin changes a template or a setting, that is logged too. This transparency helps teams trust the system and troubleshoot questions like “Did we send that second reminder yet?”.</li>
            <li>**Viewer seats:** We allow unlimited viewer-only users on paid plans since read-only sharing doesn’t pose a data risk and encourages collaboration. This way, any number of stakeholders can be given access to view reports without extra cost, driving internal adoption.</li>
            <li>**Future enterprise features:** For larger organizations, we plan SSO integration (Okta, Azure AD) so user management can follow corporate policies, and more granular permissions (e.g., a coordinator role that can send requests but not view sensitive data) to fit complex team structures.</li>
          </ul>

            </div>
          </div>
          <h3>SLOs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Email delivery success:</strong> ≥ 99.5% of reference invitation emails successfully delivered. (Monitored via email API stats for bounces/complaints — we employ domain authentication and warm-up sending IPs to maintain deliverability.)</li>
            <li><strong>Reference form availability:</strong> ≥ 99.9% (uptime of the reference submission form and recruiter dashboard, as any downtime can hinder hiring).</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis speed:</strong> P95 &lt; 10 seconds for generating the AI summary once all references are in (so once the last reference submits, the recruiter sees the final report almost instantly).</li>
            <li><strong>Daily job success:</strong> ≥ 99% (scheduled tasks like reminders and scheduled reports run on time). No more than 1% fail or are delayed beyond 1 hour without retry.</li>
            <li><strong>Data accuracy:</strong> 100% of reference answers captured without loss or truncation, and AI processing applied to all collected data (no missed questions in the output).</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Alerts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Delivery failures:</strong> If an email to a reference bounces or is undeliverable, the system immediately alerts the recruiter in-app (and via email). It suggests actions (“Email address invalid? Click to edit and re-send.”). Internally, we track bounce rates; if there’s a spike (e.g., due to spam filtering), the dev team gets an alert to investigate domain reputation or content issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Reference inactivity:</strong> If a reference hasn’t clicked their invite link within e.g. 3 days, the system can alert the recruiter, suggesting they follow up personally. This works alongside automated reminders, serving as a safety net in case multiple references stall the process.</li>
            <li><strong>AI service errors:</strong> If the AI analysis service fails (timeout or API error), we log it and fall back gracefully: the raw responses are presented without the summary, and a retry is queued. Devs get an alert to check the AI service or switch providers if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance issues:</strong> We log app performance (page load times, report generation time). If any step slows beyond thresholds (e.g., reports taking &gt;3s to load), an alert triggers so we can investigate. For example, if generating a PDF fails, an alert goes out and the app offers the web report link as an immediate alternative to the user.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage anomalies:</strong> Alerts monitor unusual usage patterns that might indicate misuse or a bug – e.g., if one account tries to send an extremely high number of reference requests in a short time. This protects service quality by flagging potential spam or infinite loop scenarios promptly.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Marketing Channels</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HR and recruitment communities:</strong> Engage on LinkedIn groups for recruiters, HR Slack communities, and forums like SHRM or Reddit’s r/recruiting. Share content such as “Reference Checking Hack: How I Saved 5 Hours Per Hire” that showcases RefCheck’s value. By contributing genuine advice (with our tool as part of the solution), we build credibility and word-of-mouth among practitioners.</li>
            <li><strong>Content marketing:</strong> Publish articles and short videos around reference checking best practices: e.g., “Top 5 Reference Questions to Always Ask,” “Why Traditional Reference Calls Fail,” etc. Each piece highlights pain points that RefCheck solves. We’ll SEO-optimize for queries like “how to do reference checks quickly” to capture organic interest from small business owners and HR managers searching for solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Webinars &amp; workshops:</strong> Host live demo webinars (“Turbocharge Your Reference Checks with AI”) targeting HR professionals and recruiters. Partner with HR software blogs or industry groups to promote these events. A live demo where we send a reference request and show a full report in minutes can convert attendees into trial users on the spot.</li>
            <li><strong>Referral loops (product-led):</strong> Every reference who interacts with RefCheck is a potential future customer. We include subtle “Powered by RefCheck” branding on the reference form and send a polite follow-up to references: “Thanks for providing feedback – if your company could use easy reference checks, learn more here.” Similarly, impressed candidates (who see that their references were handled professionally) might refer us to their HR team. These built-in touchpoints drive low-cost growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Advisor &amp; partner network:</strong> Collaborate with HR consultants and recruiting agencies. Offer them free or discounted accounts in exchange for referrals. They benefit by offering clients a streamlined reference process, and we gain trusted distribution. Also, partner with complementary services (background check companies, HRIS systems) for bundle deals or cross-promotions, positioning RefCheck as part of a modern hiring toolkit.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Sales &amp; Distribution</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Freemium funnel:</strong> Our free tier draws users in with full functionality on a limited basis (no credit card trial). We expect many small teams will upgrade to paid plans after experiencing the time saved on a couple of hires. In-app prompts will nudge upgrades when hitting limits (“You’ve used 5 of 5 free checks this month – upgrade to continue seamlessly”). This lets users see real value before committing.</li>
            <li><strong>App marketplaces:</strong> We will list RefCheck on relevant marketplaces for visibility and credibility. For instance, the Greenhouse and Lever integration directories (so ATS users discover us when looking for reference check tools), and the Zapier app directory (“reference check automation” searches). Being present where our target audience is already browsing for solutions gives us a stamp of approval and steady lead flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Enterprise outreach:</strong> For larger prospects (big companies or high-volume staffing firms), we’ll do outbound outreach. Using LinkedIn or targeted email, we’ll share compelling stats (“Clients cut reference turnaround from 5 days to 1 day”) and offer pilot programs. Case studies from beta clients can back this up. We’ll focus on verticals like tech scale-ups or retail chains with frequent hiring, where ROI is clear, and leverage internal champions to spread adoption in those orgs.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Ideal for trial and occasional use. Includes 5 reference checks per month (up to 3 references each), 1 user, and basic email support. AI analysis and summaries are fully enabled so users experience the core value. Branded as the “Starter” plan – free forever for small-scale needs (with fair-use safeguards to prevent abuse).</li>
            <li><strong>Pro – $49/month:</strong> For growing teams. Up to 20 reference checks per month, unlimited references per check, 3 users (e.g., 2 recruiters + 1 hiring manager viewer, with additional viewer-only users free), and custom question templates. Includes daily auto-reminders and Zapier integration. Email and chat support with 24h response SLA. Suited for most SMBs and agencies handling moderate hiring volume.</li>
            <li><strong>Business – $129/month:</strong> For larger organizations or heavy users. Unlimited reference checks, up to 10 users (plus unlimited viewer-only stakeholders), priority AI processing (faster analysis during peak times), advanced integrations (native ATS plugins for popular systems), and priority support (same-day response). Includes role-based permissions and audit logs. This tier ensures high-volume customers have no friction or delays.</li>
            <li><strong>Enterprise – custom pricing:</strong> Tailored for very large companies or those with specific compliance needs. Offers on-premise or dedicated cloud deployment if required, SSO/SAML integration, white-glove onboarding, and a dedicated account manager. Priced via annual contracts based on volume (e.g., $X per 100 reference checks/year) and any custom feature requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Add-ons:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>**Extra reference packs:** If Pro/Business customers occasionally exceed their monthly reference quota, they can purchase pay-as-you-go packs (e.g., $20 for 10 extra checks) rather than upgrading tiers immediately. This accommodates seasonal spikes in hiring.</li>
                <li>**White-labeling:** An add-on for Business/Enterprise where emails and the reference interface can use the customer’s branding/domain (so communications come from their company). This is a flat fee upgrade that larger clients can opt for to provide a seamless brand experience.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Trial policy:</strong> New accounts get a 14-day trial of Pro features (with e.g. 5 reference checks included) to ensure they see full value. No credit card is required to start the trial, reducing sign-up friction. We also offer a 60-day money-back guarantee on the first paid month or annual plan, to remove risk in trying RefCheck.</li>
            <li><strong>Billing &amp; Management:</strong> Monthly and annual billing options will be available (annual plans at ~20% discount to encourage commitment). Upgrades/downgrades prorate automatically so customers can change plans as their hiring needs fluctuate. The app includes a billing portal (via Stripe) for self-serve plan management and invoices.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data scope:</strong> RefCheck only accesses and stores data necessary for reference checking. This includes candidate name, job role, reference contact info, and the Q&amp;A feedback provided. We do **not** collect sensitive personal info (e.g., no payment data from references, no unrelated personal details).</li>
            <li><strong>User consent:</strong> The hiring company (our customer) is responsible for obtaining candidate consent to contact references (usually part of their application or offer process). Our system assumes this is done. References themselves provide input voluntarily; when they click the invite link, the landing page informs them that by submitting, they consent to their responses being used for the hiring decision by the requesting company. We also assure them their responses will remain confidential (not shared with the candidate).</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy compliance:</strong> We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and similar regulations. For EU users, data is processed under legitimate interest of hiring with consent; we offer data deletion on request (candidates or references can ask the hiring company or us to delete their info, and we will purge it). We’re open to signing Data Processing Agreements for clients. We don’t sell or share any data externally – even aggregated reference data isn’t shared outside the context of providing our service.</li>
            <li><strong>Data retention:</strong> Reference data is retained for a limited period – by default, 2 years – to allow companies to refer back during an employee’s tenure or in case of disputes. After that, we prompt admins to delete or archive the data. Archived data can be anonymized (names removed) and stored for analytical model improvement, if the client permits. Otherwise, we fully delete it upon retention expiry or upon client request.</li>
            <li><strong>Terms of service &amp; liability:</strong> Our ToS will clarify proper use: the hiring company agrees to use RefCheck in compliance with employment laws (e.g., not to discriminate or ask illegal questions). We require that they have rights to the data they input (like candidate contact info). We also disclaim that while RefCheck highlights information, final hiring decisions rest with the company – we don’t make automated decisions. Any AI-generated insights are assistive. Liability for any hiring decisions remains with the employer. We’ll include standard clauses limiting our liability and offering remedy (e.g., service credits) for downtime.</li>
            <li><strong>IP &amp; data use:</strong> Customers retain ownership of their data (the reference feedback belongs to them). We only use it to provide and improve the service. We might use aggregated, anonymized data to improve our AI (e.g., learning general patterns of positive vs negative feedback) or to produce industry benchmarks, but we will never disclose identifiable info or specific feedback to anyone besides the hiring company that requested it.</li>
            <li><strong>Security &amp; certifications:</strong> We follow industry best practices for security: encryption in transit (HTTPS everywhere), encryption at rest for sensitive data, regular security audits (we’ll do internal pen-testing and plan a third-party audit within the first year). As we grow, we aim for SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certification to give larger clients peace of mind. We have a breach response plan – in the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify affected clients promptly and take transparent corrective action.</li>

              <h4>Reference Response Risk</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Some references might ignore the email invite or be put off by using a new tool, leading to incomplete checks and frustrated recruiters.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Make the reference interface extremely easy and mobile-friendly (no login or app download, just a quick web chat). Emphasize that it’s quick and confidential to encourage participation. Provide guidance templates for recruiters/candidates to give heads-up to references (“You’ll get an email from our RefCheck system”) to establish legitimacy. Ensure high email deliverability by using our own verified domain and warmed IPs to avoid spam folders. If email fails, offer an SMS follow-up option (and in the future, direct SMS invites) so references can respond via text if they prefer. And as a backup, allow recruiters to record a phone reference manually into the system if needed, so the process can still be tracked.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h4>AI Misinterpretation</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk:</strong> The AI analysis might misjudge tone or context (e.g., falsely flag a polite reference as negative, or miss a subtle red flag), which could mislead recruiters or erode their trust in the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Always display the full raw responses alongside the AI summary so recruiters can verify context. Use conservative default settings – the AI only flags very clear signals initially, reducing false positives. Continuously refine our algorithms with HR expert input and machine learning on confirmed outcomes (feedback loop). Incorporate the “Was this summary accurate?” user feedback on each report; if multiple users flag inaccuracies, adjust the model/prompt accordingly. In early stages, favor recall over precision (maybe highlight fewer but definitely concerning items) to build user trust, and gradually expand as the AI proves itself.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h4>Data Sensitivity &amp; Trust</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Companies or references may worry about how the data is used or who can see it. References might fear their feedback could get back to the candidate or beyond, making them hesitant to be honest. Companies might fear data leaks of sensitive feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Communicate our confidentiality clearly: references are told their input goes only to the hiring team, not the candidate. Our system is built to keep responses confidential by default (the candidate never sees individual responses). We enable anonymizing reference identities in reports if needed (“Reference A said...”) for broader sharing. Implement strong access controls so only authorized users at the client see the data. Highlight our encryption and security measures in the UI (e.g., a “Secured by RefCheck” note) to reassure users. Over time, obtaining third-party security attestations (SOC 2) will further bolster trust with larger clients.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h4>Adoption &amp; Behavior Change</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Some recruiters/managers firmly believe that only live phone calls yield genuine insight, so they might resist switching to an automated solution. Others might procrastinate on learning a new tool during a busy hiring push.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Our go-to-market focuses on education: we’ll use case studies illustrating how RefCheck catches the same or more insights as a phone call (and often documents them better). We can offer a “hybrid” approach guide: e.g., use RefCheck for 2 out of 3 references and still call one directly, to ease transition – and show that the information quality is comparable. The free tier lowers the barrier to try it without commitment. Also, the first-use experience will be guided (tooltips, sample data) so even non-tech-savvy HR folks find it easy. If needed, we could incorporate an option for the recruiter to conduct a phone interview but input notes into our system, as a way to get them on the platform and show value (this is essentially a workaround to keep such users within our ecosystem until they’re comfortable letting AI handle it).</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h4>Third-Party Dependency</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk:</strong> We rely on external services for critical functions – e.g., email delivery providers, and AI APIs. If SendGrid has an outage, references won’t get emails; if OpenAI raises prices or changes their API, our costs or functionality could be impacted. These external factors could hurt our reliability or margins.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Design the system with flexibility and backups: integrate at least two email providers (we can automatically failover to another SMTP service if SendGrid is down). Abstract our AI calls so we can switch to another NLP provider or a custom model if needed (already in architecture). Maintain a caching layer so even if the AI is temporarily unreachable, we can reuse the last good analysis or at least deliver raw answers. Monitor usage carefully; set rate limits and usage alerts to avoid unexpected cost spikes (e.g., a bug causing an infinite analysis loop). We’ll also negotiate enterprise pricing or reserved capacity with AI providers as we scale to keep costs predictable. In worst-case scenarios, we have a manual review fallback (e.g., if AI is offline, the system can notify us to step in or simply flag we’ll send the summary later). This ensures a third-party issue doesn’t completely block the reference check process.</li>

              <h3>v1.1 (Months 2–3)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>SMS &amp; WhatsApp invites:</strong> Allow references to receive and respond to requests via text message or messaging apps. This will complement email and could significantly raise response rates for those who respond better to SMS.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional question sets:</strong> Build a library of question templates tailored to common roles or industries (sales, engineering, healthcare, etc.) based on user feedback. Recruiters can pick from these or mix-and-match, speeding up customization.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Workspace Add-on:</strong> Create a Google Sheets/Docs add-on so that a user can trigger RefCheck from Google applications (e.g., a recruiter can highlight a candidate’s name in Google Sheets and start a check). This provides another entry point for users who live in Google’s ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Dashboard analytics:</strong> Enhance the in-app dashboard with charts: e.g., average reference rating per candidate, turnaround times, reference completion trends, etc. This helps HR quantify time saved and highlight any bottlenecks (like certain positions consistently have slower reference returns).</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3>v1.2 (Months 4–6)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep ATS integrations:</strong> Develop native integrations for top ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday). For example, embed a “Start RefCheck” button directly in the ATS UI and automatically sync status and summary back into the ATS when done. This tight integration will drive adoption in mid-market and enterprise clients.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-language support:</strong> Introduce support for other languages in the reference flow (starting with Spanish, French). References can choose to view questions in their language, and we’ll use translation AI so that recruiters still get an English summary (or vice versa). This opens up non-English markets and multinational clients.</li>
                <li><strong>Voice reference transcription:</strong> As an option, enable references to provide feedback via a phone call or voice note: they could call a number, speak answers to an IVR or leave a voicemail. The system would transcribe it and then our AI analyzes it as usual. This captures those who strongly prefer talking over typing (though we expect this to be a minority, it could be useful for certain industries).</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive insights:</strong> Begin leveraging aggregated data to highlight predictive signals. For example, if our data (anonymized) shows that candidates whose references mention “attention to detail” tend to succeed more in certain roles, we can flag that as a positive predictor. Conversely, certain flagged phrases might statistically correlate with turnover. We’d carefully and ethically present this as an added insight, not a deterministic score.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3>v2.0 (Months 7–12)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Enterprise-grade platform:</strong> Add SSO/SAML login for large company security compliance, advanced admin controls (role hierarchies, org units), and full audit logs export. Possibly a self-hosted or VPC deployment option for clients in highly regulated sectors who need complete data control.</li>
                <li><strong>Background &amp; beyond:</strong> Explore adding adjacent services like background checks or credential verifications via partnerships or API integrations. For instance, after references, an employer might trigger a criminal background check or education verification – doing this in one flow could be valuable to them. This would be positioned as an add-on service to avoid product bloat.</li>
                <li><strong>AI-driven interviewer:</strong> Evolve the AI assistant to handle live chat interviews with references in real-time (if a reference is available to chat instead of filling the form). The AI could ask questions interactively and clarify answers on the fly, mimicking a human interviewer more closely. This is cutting-edge and would be tested thoroughly in beta, but could truly set us apart if done well.</li>
                <li><strong>Benchmarking &amp; insights:</strong> Provide companies with anonymized benchmarks: e.g., “Your candidates’ average reference sentiment is 8.7/10, slightly above the industry average of 8.5,” or “Compared to peers, your hiring process is 2 days faster in the reference stage.” These insights can help HR see value and optimize their process, and they leverage the data we accumulate (all anonymized/aggregated) as we scale.</li>

              <h4>Week 1</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Design &amp; setup:</strong> Finalize UI/UX designs for key screens (recruiter dashboard, reference invite form, chat interface, report view). Set up the core backend (Bubble app or Node/Express with a database). Implement user authentication and basic organization management (sign up, log in, invite team member).</li>
                <li><strong>Email integration:</strong> Integrate an email sending service (e.g., SendGrid) and verify our sending domain (SPF/DKIM) for good deliverability. Build out the function to send reference invitation emails with unique secure links. Create email templates for invites and reminders.</li>
                <li><strong>Template management:</strong> Develop the UI for question template creation/editing. Seed the system with one standard questionnaire template (5 questions). Allow saving a template to the database. Implement basic mapping of template -&gt; reference form generation.</li>
                <li><strong>Reference form prototype:</strong> Build a straightforward version of the reference input form (web page). Initially, just list the questions (from the selected template) in a basic format with text boxes, and ensure that when submitted, the answers save to the database. No AI or chat UI yet – just proving end-to-end flow (invite email -&gt; form -&gt; data capture -&gt; recruiter can see responses).</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h4>Week 2</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Conversational UI &amp; voice:</strong> Upgrade the reference form to the chat-style interface. Implement a simple client-side script to display questions one at a time and capture answers. Integrate browser speech-to-text for supported browsers (with a mic button). Ensure it gracefully degrades to typing if not supported. Test on mobile for responsiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>AI integration (analysis):</strong> Set up connections to an NLP API (likely OpenAI). Develop a server-side function to send a block of text (one reference’s answers) and receive sentiment analysis and a summary. Initially, try with a static prompt and refine as needed. Implement logic to detect certain keywords for flagging (as a backup to the AI or to feed into it).</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time processing:</strong> When a reference submits the form, trigger the AI analysis on their answers. Store the raw answers and AI results (sentiment scores, any flagged phrases, and a draft summary) in the database. Develop a basic internal view for the recruiter to see one reference’s responses as they come in (for testing, possibly on the dashboard).</li>
                <li><strong>PDF report generation:</strong> Use a library or Bubble plugin to assemble a simple PDF report. It should include the candidate name, position, each question and answer, and maybe a placeholder for summary. Get this working end-to-end (even if summary is rudimentary at this point). Ensure the PDF formatting is clean and branded with the company name/logo if possible (maybe just the company name text for now).</li>

              <h4>Week 3</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Multi-reference consolidation:</strong> Implement logic to collate multiple reference inputs under one candidate. Once all pending references for a candidate are marked completed (or if the user triggers early), generate the combined report. This involves merging all answers (organized by question) and combining the AI insights. Develop the final summary prompt that takes into account all references (e.g., “Summarize feedback from Reference A and B”). Test the AI output for multi-input coherence and adjust as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Dashboard &amp; notifications:</strong> Finish the recruiter dashboard: list all reference checks, show status (e.g., “2 of 3 references submitted”), and allow clicking into a specific report. Implement email notifications to the recruiter: e.g., “Reference 2 of 3 complete for Alice Johnson – view interim report” and “All references complete – view final report.” Also add the ability to manually send a reminder to a reference from this dashboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Scheduling &amp; cron:</strong> If time, set up a simple scheduling mechanism (could use Bubble’s recurring workflows or a cron job on Node) to send daily reminders or scheduled summary emails. At minimum, implement auto-reminder after X days. Also ensure bounced emails or errors are logged for support (maybe via SendGrid’s event webhook to catch invalid addresses).</li>
                <li><strong>Polish UI and text:</strong> Clean up any placeholder text in the UI, add help tooltips (e.g., explaining to recruiters what a “flag” means), ensure responsiveness on mobile and different browsers. Also, add a note on the reference form about confidentiality and who will see their answers, to reassure them.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h4>Week 4</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>End-to-end testing:</strong> Conduct thorough end-user testing with a small beta group (maybe 3–5 users from our network). Have them run through a real reference check scenario. Gather feedback on any confusing parts or technical issues. Fix bugs uncovered (e.g., form edge cases, email deliverability issues, AI oddities in summaries).</li>
                <li><strong>Performance &amp; security:</strong> Optimize any identified slow points (for instance, if generating a PDF is slow, consider asynchronous generation with an email link on completion). Confirm that data access is properly scoped (e.g., one company cannot access another’s data even if they guess IDs). Do a quick internal security review (using something like OWASP Zap or Bubble’s security settings) to catch obvious issues like insecure direct object references or XSS in reference inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Launch prep:</strong> Set up monitoring dashboards for key metrics (using a tool or custom admin page): e.g., number of invites sent, response times, errors. Ensure customer support channels are ready (help center with basic FAQs, an email or chat for support). Prepare initial marketing (announce on LinkedIn, schedule a demo webinar). If all looks good from beta, deploy the production version. Begin onboarding waitlist users and encourage them to share feedback/testimonials for our marketing. Also, finalize our Zapier integration (create a Zap template for “New RefCheck Completed” that sends data to common endpoints) and initiate the process to list on Zapier’s directory and key ATS marketplaces post-launch.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data verification tests:</strong> Use known test datasets to verify that the combined output matches expectations. For example, simulate two references for a candidate with known positive vs negative comments and ensure the summary reflects both. Check that if Reference A and B each answer 5 questions, the final export shows all 10 answers appropriately. Run repeated sync cycles to confirm no duplicate entries and idempotent behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration testing:</strong> End-to-end tests for each integration point: sending an email (use a test email and confirm receipt), reference form submission (simulate a user filling it on various devices/browsers), and disconnecting an integration (e.g., if we had an ATS webhook, ensure it stops on removal). Test our OAuth if any (for ATS connections) in sandbox mode.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance tests:</strong> Simulate heavy usage: e.g., 100 candidates with 3 references each all being processed around the same time. Ensure the system (especially AI API calls and PDF generation) can handle it by maybe queueing or parallelizing appropriately without crashes or huge delays. Optimize database queries (add indexes if needed on user org, candidate id, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Security &amp; privacy checks:</strong> Perform a security audit of the app: test for XSS by inputting scripts in reference answers and verifying they don’t execute in the report view. Test for broken access controls: e.g., try changing reference check IDs in the URL to access another company’s data (it should fail). Ensure tokens in invite links are unguessable. Check that logs and downloaded reports don’t inadvertently contain sensitive tokens or information.</li>
            <li><strong>Email deliverability tests:</strong> Use test accounts on common email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) to ensure our invitation and reminder emails land in the inbox (not spam). Adjust email content (avoiding spammy phrases) and authenticate the sending domain fully. Monitor initial send reputation; do gradual ramp-up if needed to warm the IP. Also verify that the email footer includes an unsubscribe (for compliance, even though it’s transactional, it builds trust).</li>
            <li><strong>User acceptance testing:</strong> Have a small group of pilot customers run real hiring scenarios through RefCheck. Gather qualitative feedback: Was it easier? Did references complain? Did they trust the summaries? Use this to tweak copy (maybe add more explanation in emails or UI if needed) and prioritize any last-minute fixes or features before a broader release.</li>
